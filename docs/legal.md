# Legal Considerations

## Scope

This is a **personal, non-commercial tool**. Both data sources can be used freely for personal purposes.

## OMI Quotation CSVs

- **Source:** Freely downloadable from the Agenzia delle Entrate portal (requires SPID authentication for download, but the data itself is not restricted)
- **License:** No explicit open license is attached to the download. However, as public administration data, they are arguably covered by the open-by-default principle of art. 52 of the Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale (CAD, D.Lgs. 82/2005)
- **Attribution requirement:** Source must be cited as "Agenzia delle Entrate -- OMI"
- **Personal use:** Unrestricted
- **Commercial redistribution:** Legal grey area. Likely permissible with attribution, but no explicit license grants this right

## Declared Transaction Values

- **Source:** "Consultazione Valori Immobiliari Dichiarati" service on the Agenzia delle Entrate portal
- **Legal basis:** Subject to the special regime established by art. 1, commi 367-373, Legge 30 dicembre 2004, n. 311
- **Open data exclusion:** Explicitly excluded from the scope of D.Lgs. 24 gennaio 2006, n. 36 (Italian transposition of the EU Open Data Directive). This means they are NOT classified as reusable public sector information
- **Personal use:** Permitted (the web viewer is available to any SPID-authenticated citizen)
- **Commercial redistribution:** **NOT permitted.** The data cannot be redistributed, republished, or used commercially
- **Automation:** The Agenzia provides no API and no export facility; the terms of service likely prohibit automated scraping

## If This Tool Were Ever Made Public

Even for free, non-commercial public access:
- **OMI quotations:** Likely OK with proper attribution, but verify with current regulations
- **Declared transaction values:** **Cannot be redistributed** to other users. The manual transaction entries in this tool must remain private
